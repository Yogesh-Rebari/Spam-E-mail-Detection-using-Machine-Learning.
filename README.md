# Spam-E-mail-Detection-using-Machine-Learning.
In this project, I have developed a robust Spam Email Detection System leveraging various machine learning algorithms. The primary goal of this project is to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham) with high accuracy, ensuring an efficient and automated filtering mechanism to enhance user experience and security.
